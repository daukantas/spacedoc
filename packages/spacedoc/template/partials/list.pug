//- Render a list of doclets. If the doclets came from an adapter that defines types for doclets, then they will be arranged in the order of those types.

//- @param {String} type - Adapter the doclets came from.
//- @param {?String[]} categories - Groups to list doclets by.
//- @todo Find a way to simplify this call. Perhaps allow the adapter to define the signature of the mixin call?

Error in configuring Spacedoc:
  No file called spacedoc.yml was found in the current folder.
  If you'd like to use a different file to configure Spacedoc,
  pass the --config flag to the CLI like so:
  spacedoc --config kittens.yml

  No file called %s was found in the current folder. Make
  sure the file you're passing to spacedoc --config is spelled
  right. Or, you can remove the --config flag and Spacedoc
  will try to load a file called spacedoc.yml instead.

  config() was called without any parameters, so Spacedoc tried
  to load a file called spacedoc.yml, but couldn't find it. Make
  sure your configuration file is named spacedoc.yml.
  Alternatively, you can:
    - Pass in the path to your custom config file.
      spacedoc.config('kittens.yml')
    - Pass in a JavaScript object of config settings.
      spacedoc.config({ src: 'docs/*.md', ... })

  config() was called with the file path %s, but that file couldn't
  be loaded. Make sure the path is spelled correctly. You can also
  name your config file spacedoc.yml and call config() with no
  parameters.
